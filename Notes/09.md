## Right Hand Rule of Robotics

The right hand rule is a convention used to define the orientation of axes in a 3D coordinate system. In robotics, it helps standardize the direction of the X, Y, and Z axes:

- **X-axis:** Forward
- **Y-axis:** Left
- **Z-axis:** Up

To use the right hand rule, point your right hand's thumb, index, and middle finger perpendicular to each other:

- Thumb: X-axis
- Index: Y-axis
- Middle: Z-axis

## Roll, Pitch, Yaw (Euler Angles)

These are the three angles that describe the orientation of a robot or sensor in 3D space:

- **Roll (X-axis):** Rotation around the X-axis
- **Pitch (Y-axis):** Rotation around the Y-axis
- **Yaw (Z-axis):** Rotation around the Z-axis

They are commonly used in robotics to represent orientation, especially for mobile robots and manipulators.

## Coordinate Frame Hierarchy

Robotic systems use multiple coordinate frames to describe the position and orientation of different parts:

- **World Frame (Map Frame):**
  - The global reference frame for the environment.
  - All other frames are defined relative to this frame.

- **Base Frame:**
  - The main frame attached to the robot's base (e.g., the center of a mobile robot).

- **Sensor Frame:**
  - The frame attached to a sensor (e.g., camera, lidar) mounted on the robot.

- **Joint Frame:**
  - The frame attached to a robot joint, used in manipulators and arms.

- **End-Effector Frame:**
  - The frame attached to the robot's end-effector (e.g., gripper, tool).

- **Odometry Frame:**
  - The frame used to track the robot's estimated position over time, often updated by wheel encoders or other sensors.
