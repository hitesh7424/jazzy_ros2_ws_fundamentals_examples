# ROS 2 Topic and Node Commands

This document provides a list of essential ROS 2 commands for working with topics and nodes. These commands are useful for debugging, monitoring, and interacting with ROS 2 systems.

## Running the Publisher Node

Run the `py_minimal_publisher` node from the `ros2_fundamental_examples` package:

```bash
ros2 run ros2_fundamental_examples py_minimal_publisher.py
```

## Topic Commands

### List all available topics

```bash
ros2 topic list
```

### Echo messages from a specific topic

```bash
ros2 topic echo /py_example_topic
```

### Check the publishing frequency of a topic

```bash
ros2 topic hz /py_example_topic
```

### Get information about a topic

```bash
ros2 topic info /py_example_topic
```

### Get detailed information about a topic

```bash
ros2 topic info /py_example_topic --verbose
```

### Display the interface (message type) of a topic

```bash
ros2 interface show std_msgs/msg/String
```

### Publish a message to a topic manually

```bash
ros2 topic pub /py_example_topic std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'hello'}"
```

## Node Commands

### List all active nodes

```bash
ros2 node list
```

### Get information about a specific node

```bash
ros2 node info /minimal_py_publisher
```

## Visualization

### Visualize the ROS 2 graph

Use `rqt_graph` to visualize the nodes and topics in your ROS 2 system:

```bash
rqt_graph
```

## Notes

- Replace `/py_example_topic` with the name of your topic if you are working with a different one.
- Ensure that the `py_minimal_publisher` node is running before using commands like `ros2 topic echo` or `ros2 topic hz`.
- Use `rqt_graph` to get a graphical overview of the communication between nodes and topics.
